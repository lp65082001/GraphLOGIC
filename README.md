## Introduction
GraphLOGIC: Graph-based Lethality predictor for OsteoGenesis Imperfecta for Collagen is implementation osteogenesis imperfecta of model for structural-informed lethality prediction. The code is published with "Developing clinical lethality predictive model of Osteogenesis Imperfecta by using graph neural network".

On the other hand, others checkpoint and structure data were available in https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24633969

## Environment

The model is training on the hardware Cpu:r5 3600 only with pytorch and pytorch_geometric framework.

## Prediction

You can easy to run predicter.py to get result:
